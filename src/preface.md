Our audience are professional developers cross training from languages such as C, C++, Python and Golang. Topics we'll cover include:

- Basic workflow and usage of Cargo, the build system and package manager
- Syntax, structs, and primitive data types
- The borrow checker: it's like pair programming with the compiler
- Traits, a functional-friendly alternative to OOP
- Enums and algebraic data types (much more powerful and safe than C)
- Modeling a domain using the strong type system (such as a state machine)
- Generics, using strong types to avoid C and C++ weaknesses
- FFI, calling C libraries, using unsafe Rust, and wrapper generation from C headers
- Cross compiling for the linux arm target

We will build on and link heavily to the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [Standard Library documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) but if you ever get lost you should take it upon yourself to head back there to find clarification. A huge part of why Rust is so powerful is its evolving, responsive, tested, up to date and clear documentation. Many thanks to the tireless authors of those resources. 

Before getting started, make sure you have Rust installed and configured in your favorite editor. We have a guide for installation on Windows.
